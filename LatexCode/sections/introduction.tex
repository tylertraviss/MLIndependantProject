After looking at a single-layer perceptron neural network in my secondary education, a simple quadratic polynomial fitter made myself question the capabilities of neural networks in computing. This opportunity to expand knowledge on such a paramount part of the technological revolution is essential to my growth as a software engineer. \\

This paper is cohesive with a public GitHub repository with any relevant code/data to the research. \\

The goal of this paper is to have reference to the key elements of Machine Learning, as a guided description of my discoveries. \\

Topics will be drawn from academia, novels, and public GitHub repositories. Literature on Machine Learning will be useful to grasp concepts of the structural architecture and procedure of an algorithm. Albeit understanding is the most important factor, I also plan on looking at examples of machine learning with the goal deciphering what is going on under the hood.
