<p align="center">What was Achieved</p>
In compliance with requirements for UNB's SWE4913 curriculum. The intent of this project was to build knowledge on the basic principles of machine learning models.

- Used TensorFlow library to build a three-layer sequential neural network model. The model intakes a 28 x 28 picture of some article of clothing, which is processed in a hidden dense layer, which uses the RELU activation function. The output layer describes an output based off confidence on which article of clothing it is.

- Learned about Adam Optimizer for stochastic gradient descent for the suited properties, our loss function cross-entropy assisted help guide the model.

- Built a model that only after 25 epochs, neural network model managed 94% accuracy with trained data, with a loss function value of 0.1590.

- Research on (15+) neural network research studies. Compared GoogLeNet, ResNet, VGGNet, 2D-LTSM, CNN on standardized car driving test.

- Learned about the efforts being done with greedy search algorithms to increase neuron coverage of synthetic test images.
