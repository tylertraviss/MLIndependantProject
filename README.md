<h1 align="center">Project title</h1>

we are using, align="center" because we can't use CSS here.

Description
After the title, you must provide a description of the project and it should not be a long paragraph just a simple descriptive line will do the job. This is the line that should be well crafted and straightforward.
It describes the quality of your project because no one will run the project at the moment they visit but they judge the project its description.

# Project Description

or if also like to make it at the center so,

<p align="center">Project Description</p>

Table of Content
Github added this feature already so you don't need to do it. So, Just use headings (#), subheadings(#), or h1,h2 tags and it will automatically have at the top left corner of your README.md file.

Links
Use markdown link as [Link Text](link) of your live project, repo, API, API repo. I am sure you are wondering why you should put repo here but your project is not always be seen on GitHub people also clone it on their system and this file also gets cloned so you must put this link there. So, anyone can visit back the repo.

Include screenshots
You can use Images to show your project, how it looks while running. For putting screenshots you can either drag and drop images or use the image in markdown as ![Image Name](Image location)

How to use your software
The most important part after the description is this, You need to provide instruction on how to install your program and how to run it. Make it comprehensive as much as possible So, even a beginner can use it.

Built With

Future updates

## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start" : "react-scripts start"`,

The app is built using `create-react-app` so this command Runs the app in Development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. You also need to run the server file as well to completely run the app. The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `"npm run build": "react-scripts build"`,

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app will be ready to deploy!

### `"npm run test": "react-scripts test"`,

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `"npm run dev": "concurrently "nodemon server" "npm run start"`,

For running the server and app together I am using concurrently this helps a lot in the MERN application as it runs both the server (client and server) concurrently. So you can work on them both together.

### `"serve": "node server"`

For running the server file on you can use this command.

### `npm run serve`

## Built With

Hello Rohit Jain,

thanks for your article.
It's very informative and I've tried some things you explained in a test repo

I ran into an issue that will not allow me to like and share your article.
Problem is as follows:
Uploading an image using drag and drop saves the image in user-images.githubusercontent.com.
Here is an example:

user-images.githubusercontent.com/...

While looking for a solution, I found the following content on stackoverflow:
Can images on 'user-images.githubusercontent.com' be deleted?

It does not seem possible to delete uploaded images after using drag and drop. I understand this lack of control for the user comes from GitHub.

However, please consider to mention this problem in your article or even offer a solution on how to delete the images so uploaded.
I would love to give a heart and share your article on twitter.

Hi Akin,
Thanks for Reading my blog.

That's raw content, you can upload files in repo and use that instead of using drag n drop, that will give you all the control.
